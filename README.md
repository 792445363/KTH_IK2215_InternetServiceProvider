This is the ISP project in KTH IK2215 Advanced Internetworking. 

I put the project introduction file and project configuration instructions in the Intro folder. I am in project group113 with Tangyujun Han. Following the description in the intro and report, this project tells you to learn how to build an ISP service in the virtual machine. The copyright of this project belongs to KTH IK2215 course.

If you like this project, any stars will help, thanks!


The main objectives of the project assignment are to:

give you hands-on experience in designing, configuring & handling TCP/IP networks, and providing services as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to end users by primarily using PC hardware and Unix;

help you to gain insights into how an underlying network influences deployed services;

learn to test and troubleshoot configurations of your network and services;

provide a venue for you to describe and discuss network design and implementation; and
learn to work professionally.
