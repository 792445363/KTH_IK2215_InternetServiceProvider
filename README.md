# KTH_IK2215_InternetServiceProvider
This is the ISP project in KTH IK2215 Advanced Internetworking. 
I put the project introduction file and project configuration instructions in the Intro folder.

The main objectives of the project assignment are to:

give you hands-on experience in designing, configuring & handling TCP/IP networks, and providing services as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to end users by primarily using PC hardware and Unix;

help you to gain insights into how an underlying network influences deployed services;

learn to test and troubleshoot configurations of your network and services;

provide a venue for you to describe and discuss network design and implementation; and
learn to work professionally.
